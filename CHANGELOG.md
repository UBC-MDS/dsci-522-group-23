### Feedback:
Versions are missing from environment files(s) for all Python packages
### Changes Made:
Specify versions for all Python packages in the environment files.
### Evidence:
Check the environment.yml: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/blob/main/environment.yml 

## 5. M1 feedback from teaching team: Introduction issues
### Feedback:
- Target/response variable needs to be more clearly defined. 
- Did not clearly identify and describe the dataset that was used to answer the question.
### Changes Made:
The target variable has been clearly defined, and the dataset used to answer the question has been identified and described in detail within the Introduction section.
### Evidence:
Commit: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/commit/d06bd75d9236f7fa5e59c271ccf59bde1c43bca6

## 6. M2 feedback from teaching team: The platform key and value is missing from the docker-compose.yml file, 
### Feedback:
The platform key and value is missing from the  docker-compose.yml file, causing issues when running on different chip architectures.
### Changes Made:
Replaced `jupyter-notebook:` with `student-performance-predictor-env:` to ensure a more specific and appropriate service name.
### Evidence:
Commit: [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/commit/d06bd75d9236f7fa5e59c271ccf59bde1c43bca6](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/commit/008b657bfcfd1ed416e948bf9621d543d31d5805)

## 7. M2 feedback from teaching team: Reproducibility
### Feedback:
Could not reproducibly run the analysis because the computational environment cannot be recreated from the provided instructions and/or environment specification files.
### Changes Made:
We replaced the process of building the image locally with pulling the pre-built image directly from our DockerHub repository.
### Evidence:
Commit: [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/commit/d06bd75d9236f7fa5e59c271ccf59bde1c43bca6](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/commit/008b657bfcfd1ed416e948bf9621d543d31d5805)

## 8. Feedback from Peer Review: Results & Discussion Section
### Feedback:
The section lacked depth in explaining coefficients, model limitations, and the role of multicollinearity. Additionally, the justification for using Ridge Regression and discussion of results needed more clarity.
### Changes Made:
Expanded discussion on the model coefficients, explained the linearity assumption and provided examples, improved clarity on Ridgeâ€™s handling of multicollinearity through coefficient shrinkage and clarified why Ridge Regression was chosen.
### Evidence:
resolved git issue: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522-group-23/issues/60
