    "Math teaches us to think logically and it also provides us with analytical and problem-solving skills. These skills can be applied to various academic and professional fields. However, student performance in mathematics can be influenced by many factors, like individual factor, social factor, and family factor. Research has shown that attributes such as study habits, age and family background can significantly impact a student's academic success  (Amuda, Bulus, and Joseph 2016; Modi 2023). Understanding these factors is crucial for improving educational outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aim to address this question: **“Can we predict a student's math academic performance based on the demographic and behavioral data?”**. Answering this question is important because understanding the factors behind student performance can help teachers provide support to struggling students. Furthermore, the ability to predict academic performance could assist schools in developing educational strategies based on different backgrounds of students. \n",
    "The goal of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting student’s math performance with high accuracy."
